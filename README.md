# What Bird is That? ðŸ¦œ ðŸ“¸
Computer vision website which identifies the species of birds by user-uploaded photos

# This project is in very early stages

# todo (for initial "release"):
1. Finish training model
2. Add model training notebook to repo
3. deploy streamlit app
4. Add video demonstration to repo

# version 2:
1. introduce autocrop option using YOLOv5 object detection

Add options for secondary models (like b0-b4)

# ideas for better models:
1. try data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator
2. get equal number of images for each class using data augmentation
